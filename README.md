# thebarwithnoname
Simple website for The Bar With No Name; utilizing AngularJS and Bootstrap.

Notable features & achievements:
  1. First commissioned project,
  2. Simple design due primarily to no resources provided by client (i.e., photography of bar/food), and
  3. Automated daily special.
  
Challenges:
  1. No resources or budget to retrieve customized resources of the bar (i.e., photography of bar/food).
  
Need to address:
  1. Automate the dates for Magic the Gathering event. At the time of development (and still), the owner doesn't know how long this will continue for so it wasn't automated. However it has been active since July, so I will be automating it soon, and
  2. "Drinks" section design needs to be updated to match the stylings of the "Menu"; the stock image looks out of place, but the client likes it and wants it to stay.
